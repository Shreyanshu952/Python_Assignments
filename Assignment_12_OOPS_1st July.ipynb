    "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) To make the development and maintenance of projects more effortless. \n",
    "2) To provide the feature of data hiding that is good for security concerns.  \n",
    "3) We can solve real-world problems if we are using object-oriented programming. \n",
    "4) It ensures code reusability. \n",
    "5) It lets us write generic code: which will work with a range of data, so we don’t have to write basic stuff over and over again."
